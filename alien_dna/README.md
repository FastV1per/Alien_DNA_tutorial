"Hello world!"

Welcome to a small introduction of bioinformatics. What is bioinformatics? Bioinformatics is a sub-branch of biotechnology where we take biological data to understand and analyze with multiple interface programs. Before we get started, we need to download some software and that would depend on your operating system. Your operating system (OS) is the program that runs your computer. For example, WindowsOS and MacOS are operating systems. How you're seeing this "README.md" file is through your operating system. Although bioinformatician use Windows and Mac for day to day use, where they store data and compile their analysis is through LinuxOS. How do you check what operating system you have? All apple products have MacOS, anything else uses WindowsOS EXCEPT Chrombook. Chrombook uses ChromeOS. 

#Downloading LinuxOS

##Windows
Please download the following programs here:


##Mac
MacOS is a Unix based operating system. Unix and Linux are sister programs, so bascially you'll have an easier time running linux programs anywhere. Please download the following program here:

##Chrombook
ChromeOS is a Linux based operating system. You should be relieved as you only need to enable it. Please follow the following intstructions here: 

1. On your Chromebook, at the bottom right, select the time
2. Select Settings > Advanced > Developers 
3. Next to "Linux development environment" select Turn ON
4. Follow the on-screen instructions. Setup can take 10 minutes or more. 
5. A terminal window opens. That is what you'll be working on. You have a Debian 11 (Bullseye) environment. Side note: Not alot of researchers use Debian but a couple of gaming companies use this if they wanted to remaster old PC games.
